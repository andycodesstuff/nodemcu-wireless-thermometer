/**
 * A thermistor is a resistor whose resistance is dependant on temperature. There are 2 types of thermistors:
 *  - NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors, which decrease their resistance as the temperature raises
 *  - PTC (Positive Temperature Coefficient) thermistors, which increase their resistance as the temperature raises
 * 
 * Most electronic thermometers are of the former type.
 *
 * Useful resources that were used to build this library:
